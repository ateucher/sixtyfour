## General guidelines

This article outlines how to propose a change to `sixtyfour`. For more information about contributing to this, and other WILDS projects, please see the [**WILDS Contributing Guide**](https://getwilds.org/guide/).

### Fixing typos/docs changes

You can fix typos, spelling mistakes, or grammatical errors in the documentation directly using the GitHub web interface, as long as the changes are made in the _source_ file.

### Bigger changes

If you want to make a bigger change, it's a good idea to first file an issue and make sure someone from the team agrees that it’s needed.

If you’ve found a bug, please file an issue that illustrates the bug with a minimal
reproducible example using [reprex](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex).

#### Pull request process

* Fork the package and clone onto your computer
* Create a Git branch for your pull request (PR)
* Make your changes, commit to git, and then create a pull request.
  * The title of your PR should briefly describe the change.
  * The body of your PR should contain `Fixes #issue-number`.
* For user-facing changes, add a bullet to the `NEWS.md` file.

#### Code style

* New code should follow the [WILDS style guide](https://getwilds.org/guide/style.html).

## Testing

We strive to have all tests that do HTTP requests do so against resources that are not actual AWS accounts given the drawbacks with using real accounts, e.g., setting them up can be difficult at some organizations; forgotten resources can be expensive; accidentally making unwated changes to an account, etc.

We use two tools to replace real AWS accounts: Minio, Localstack.

### Minio

We use [Minio][] for testing functions in this package (functions that start with `aws_bucket` and `aws_file`) for interacting with S3.

#### Local

If you want to run tests while contributing to `sixtyfour`, the tests that use Minio will just be skipped if you don't have Minio running.

To use Minio, first install it for your platform: [MacOS](https://min.io/docs/minio/macos/index.html), [Windows](https://min.io/docs/minio/windows/index.html), [Linux](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/index.html).

Next, start Minio. Within this package is a make target `minio_start` for starting Minio locally. That make target should only work on Linux and MacOS platforms. To start Minio on the command line see the docs links above for each platform.

Upon starting Minio it will display URLs for both the Minio API and WebUI - and your username/password to login to the WebUI. You can open up the WebUI as a nice visual dashboard of what's going on.

#### GitHub Actions

The `R-CMD-check` workflow in `.github/workflows/` includes spinning up Minio for running unit tests - but only on Linux; tests that require Minio are skipped on MacOS and WIndows platforms on GitHub Actions.

#### Minio Details

The following (collapsed) bullets list information for those who want to know more about the minio setup, and that may want to tweak it or add minio setup to other tests.

<details><summary>Expand for details</summary>

- `tests/testthat/helper-minio.R` has helper functions for Minio. `bucket_delete` and `buckets_empty` make it easier to do cleanup in tests. The `minio_available` function is to be used inside `skip_if_not` to skip the tests in the file if Minio is not available, like: `skip_if_not(minio_available(), "Minio Not Available")`
- At the top of any file that uses Minio, setup the interfaces to Minio like:

```r
Sys.setenv(AWS_PROFILE = "minio")
buckets_empty() # empty buckets so we're starting from an empty slate
```

- And unset at the bottom of the file to cleanup:

```r
buckets_empty() # empty buckets
Sys.unsetenv("AWS_PROFILE")
```

Internally we grab client objects for `paws` and `s3fs` as needed and use `AWS_PROFILE` env var to toggle on/off using Minio.

### Localstack

We use [Localstack][ls] for testing some functions in this package.

#### Local

If you want to run tests while contributing to `sixtyfour`, the tests that use Localstack will just be skipped if you don't have Minio running.

To use Localstack, first install it for your platform <https://docs.localstack.cloud/getting-started/installation/>.

Next, start Localstack. Within this package is a make target `localstack_start` for starting Localstack locally. That make target should only work on Linux and MacOS platforms. To start Localstack on the command line see the docs links above for each platform. You'll need Docker installed and running to run Localstack. There are probably non-Docker ways to run Localstack.

For a GUI interface to the locally running localstack you can install the Desktop client - which isn't very good - at <https://docs.localstack.cloud/getting-started/installation/#localstack-desktop>. Better yet, login to the cloud Localstack site and you can interface with your locally running Localstack in the better interface there. Login at <https://app.localstack.cloud/>.

#### GitHub Actions

The `R-CMD-check` workflow in `.github/workflows/` includes spinning up Localstack for running unit tests - but only on Linux; tests that require Localstack are skipped on MacOS and WIndows platforms on GitHub Actions.

#### Localstack Details

The following (collapsed) bullets list information for those who want to know more about the Localstack setup, and that may want to tweak it or add Localstack setup to other tests.
