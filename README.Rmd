## Installation

Development version

```{r eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("getwilds/sixtyfour")
```

## Documentation

Go to <http://getwilds.org/sixtyfour/> for `sixtyfour` package documentation. Go to the **Get Started** vignette to get started.

This package leans primarily on the packages [paws][] and [s3fs][].

## Bugs? Features?

Open an issue on our [issue tracker](https://github.com/getwilds/sixtyfour/issues/).

## Developers

- See the targets in the Makefile for various package maintenance tasks.
- For scanning for secrets see the make target `scan_secrets` in the Makefile.
- We use [minio][] for testing functions in this package (start with `aws_bucket`, and `aws_file`) for interacting with S3. See the make target `minio_start` for starting minio locally. The `R-CMD-check` workflow in `.github/workflows/` includes spinning up minio for running unit tests - only on linux. If you run tests and minio is not available then tests that require it will be skipped.
